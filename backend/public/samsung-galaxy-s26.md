I've put together a comprehensive, high-energy blog post for you. It's written in clean, modern Markdown with a focus on "skimmable" formatting (bullet points, bold text, and clear headers) to satisfy both SEO crawlers and actual human readers.

I've incorporated all the latest "just-launched" details from February 2026, including the **Privacy Display** tech, the **Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5** chipset, and the official **Indian pricing** starting at ₹1,39,999.

### Key Highlights for the User:

* **SEO Optimized:** Included keywords like "Price in India," "Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5," "Galaxy Unpacked 2026," and "Privacy Display."
* **Current Info:** Used the actual confirmed launch date of February 25, 2026, and the general sale date of March 11.
* **Visual Structure:** Used tables, bold text, and lists to make the blog easy to read on mobile devices.

Would you like me to add a comparison section against the iPhone 17 Pro Max or a more detailed breakdown of the AI features?
